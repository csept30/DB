[14] Write a database trigger on Library table. The System should keep track of the records that are being
updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in Library_Audit table.

-- Create Library_Audit table
CREATE TABLE Library_Audit (
    action VARCHAR(10), -- Action performed: 'UPDATE' or 'DELETE'
    book_id INT,
    book_title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    old_status VARCHAR(50), -- Old status of the book before the update or delete
    audit_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create trigger on Library table
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER Library_Trigger
BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF UPDATING THEN
        INSERT INTO Library_Audit (action, book_id, book_title, author, old_status)
        VALUES ('UPDATE', :OLD.book_id, :OLD.book_title, :OLD.author, :OLD.status);
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        INSERT INTO Library_Audit (action, book_id, book_title, author, old_status)
        VALUES ('DELETE', :OLD.book_id, :OLD.book_title, :OLD.author, :OLD.status);
    END IF;
END;
